# DRAGON DUEL!

!['Dragons!'](https://www.totallywicked-eliquid.co.uk/vaped/wp-content/uploads/Dragon-Fight.jpg)

***Are you ready to take on a team of powerful chromatic dragons!?!?***


## Challenge

  Using the API from the Readme, create a project were users can select a champion from an array of champions and a dragon to square off against.

Once chosen the player and the dragon will fight their hardest to defeat one another until only one is left standing. 

In the end the player will either celebrate victory or wallow in defeat

*\*For an example of this code in action see: http://dragon-vue.herokuapp.com/#/*

## Requirements
**Functionality**
  - Once a game is started do not allow for changing champions until the game is ended (or page reloaded)
  - Champion and Dragon status is updated automatically after every attack

**Visualization**
  - Players must see a list of all possible champions and dragons to play from
  - When players create a new game all possible attacks are drawn as buttons to the screen
  - When a player wins/loses the screen will notify them and they will have the chance to play again
  
  
### Stretch Goals
  - If a player leaves the game when they return they can chose from a list of games to return to where they left off
  - Replicate the navigation from the demo, where players choose champion and dragon then play and a seperate window loads, also on defeat replace window with end game window.
